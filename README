Implements some of the algorithms in the books:

* A couple of essential libraries

library: (mpl rnrs-sans)

Exports all of '(rnrs)' except for procedures which conflict with
those provided by the mpl libraries.

So basically, if you usually begin your R6RS code by importing
'(rnrs)' and you'd like to make use of the MPL libraries without
having to worry about naming conflicts, import '(mpl rnrs-sans)'
instead.


library: (mpl all)

Exports the commonly used procedures and macros offered by MPL.

It is generally the case each MPL component is defined in it's own
library. For example, the the library '(mpl algebraic-expand)' exports
the single procedure 'algebraic-expand'. When designing R6RS libraries
which make use of MPL libraries, many users will choose to import
individual MPL libraries a la carte. However, when you're
experimenting at a REPL, it can get tedious to import the libraries
individually. Thus the '(mpl all)' library is provided so that you can
get the common parts of MPL in one import.
